# goBILDA

[goBILDA](https://www.gobilda.com/) is a fixed-pitch, **channel**-based building system using metric units. It was recently released in the 2018-2019 season and is made by the same company as Actobotics.

## Special Considerations

- goBILDA is based on metric measurements using M4 hardware. The hole pattern has 4mm holes on an 8mm grid.
- The kit is primarily structured around **U-channel**, which is strong and durable.
- goBILDA's robust motion system allows teams to easily build drivetrains and mechanisms without worrying about placement and tensioning.
- It is arguable, but goBILDA has likely a low learning curve due to its simple yet extremely functional catalog of parts.
- goBILDA parts can generally be easily adapted to other kit parts such as REV.
- Additionally, goBILDA is still being developed at a quick pace and is responsive to the needs of the FTC® community.
- **goBILDA offers a 25% discount for** *FIRST®* **teams**.

## Notable Components

- goBILDA uses **8mm pitch chain** and HTD 3 or HTD 5 **belts** for motion.
- goBILDA mostly uses **clamping hubs** (called Sonic hubs), eliminating the unreliable **set screws**.
- goBILDA **shafts** are metric (**6mm D** and **8mm rounded hex**).
- The primary structural component is the 48mm aluminum **U-channel**, shown below.

- **Low-Side channel** (smaller profile channel) complements full-size channel. Low-Side channel is just 12mm in height and allows for more compact builds. Additionally, Low-Side channel opens up possibilities such as a kit-based **parallel plate drivetrain**. Low-Side channel also forms the basis of the cascading kit with a 2 or 4 stage option.

- **Mini-Low-Side channel** (even smaller profile channel) complements Low-Side channel. Mini-Low-Side channel is 12mm tall and just 32mm wide, making it great for small structures.

- **Viper-Slides** are goBILDA's version of the commonly used drawer slides for linear extension in 336mm and 240mm lengths. Notably, goBILDA sells a Viper-Slide kit, which contains all of the parts to assemble either a 2-stack or 4-stack of slides. In addition, they are one of the few vendors who sell a belted version of these slides. The 240mm slide is also uniquely bidirectional, sliding both ways.

- **goRAIL** is **extrusion** that complements the **channel** offerings well. goRAIL is used in the linear actuator kit for extending mechanisms.

## Verdict

goBILDA's kit is a solid, albeit slightly more expensive, option for new teams. It offers a great deal of flexibility and part options from their catalog. goBILDA is a solid choice due to reasonable pricing, low learning curve, and thought-out design that reduces headaches.

## Kit of Parts

- [2023-2024 Kit Parts](https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-kit-2023-2024-season/)

## Advantages

- goBILDA's Low-Side U-channel opens up many new possibilities due to its flexibility and compactness. For example, one can now make a **parallel plate drivetrain** without custom machining or make custom-width **U-channel**.
- goBILDA also has **Servoblocks** (identical to Actobotics, other than hole pattern) which drastically increase servo life.
- goBILDA has native large bore **hex shaft** support (12 mm REX is comparable to 3/8" rounded hex), which is one of the main advantages of custom fabrication brought to a kit-based system.
- goBILDA also interfaces with **TETRIX** **channel** because they share some holes. For more information about TETRIX-goBILDA compatibility, check out this [website](https://gobildatetrix.blogspot.com/). It is also quite compatible with REV's ecosystem.
- goBILDA has a well-thought-out **ball bearing** based motion system with smart motion transfer. It is easy to do **chain** or **belt** in channel.

  > **Note**: 8mm **chain**, HTD 3, and HTD 5 mm **belt** can do perfect **C2C (center to center)** on the goBILDA pattern. This saves a lot of headaches when needing to calculate **C2C** distances.

- goBILDA has plenty of **shaft**, **ball bearing**, and pillow block options.
- goBILDA motors can **face mount** natively into **channel**, eliminating the need for motor mounts and providing a robust, reliable way to mount motors.
- goBILDA has some special parts that are unavailable in other systems, like **square beam shafts**.
- goBILDA provides a large selection of 12V DC motors. Their **Yellow Jacket motors** use orbital gearboxes and are available in 10 different gear ratios ranging from 30 RPM to 1620 RPM. No other manufacturer offers such varied gear ratios out of the box.

## Disadvantages

- goBILDA is not the cheapest build system; it is relatively equivalent in pricing to Actobotics, but REV is cheaper.
- goBILDA **U-channels** are larger than the **channels** from Tetrix, resulting in larger builds. However, this is more than compensated by the fact that one can put a **goBILDA motor** *inside* a **channel**. In addition, the introduction of mini-low-side channel allows for more compact builds where needed.
- Because of metric pattern spacing, goBILDA utilizes 8mm pitch **chain**, as opposed to the FTC standard #25 Imperial **chain**. This means that other kits' **chain** and **sprockets** won't work with goBILDA **chain** and **sprockets**.
