# Tips and Tricks

In addition to what is written in the official resources, there are a couple of additional tips.

The traditional `XT30` connector that is used with REV is prone to breaking. It is highly recommended that teams replace `XT30` connectors with `Anderson PowerPole`, or put adapters on their current wires. An example of an adapter is [`this`](https://www.servocity.com/anderson-powerpole-to-female-xt30-adaptor). In lieu of this, teams can also 3D print strain relief connectors on the Expansion Hub to prevent `XT30` disconnects. The file can be found on Thingiverse or through this [link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2887045).

The Tamiya connectors found on many of the FTCÂ® legal batteries are very weak and prone to becoming unreliable after many repeated plug/unplug cycles. It is recommended that teams crimp new `Anderson PowerPole` connectors onto the battery.

It is highly recommended for teams to use the [`REV grounding strap`](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/) and the [`REV USB strain relief`](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1214/) to help prevent disconnections.

To protect wires, teams often use [`wire loom`](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Split-Tubing-Cover-Marine/dp/B00J7RD6ZI/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=wire+loom&qid=1562452458&s=gateway&sr=8-13), and to help wires extend far, teams often use cable carrier (also known as cable chain).
