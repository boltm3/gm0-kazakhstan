# Motor Glossary

## Core Hex Motor
The Core Hex Motor, sold by REV, is different from the standard [RS-555 series motors](#rs-550-series-motor) that are generally used by FTC™ teams. It features a 90-degree orientation and does not contain an output shaft. Thus, teams will have to cut 5 mm hex shaft to length as needed. The Core Hex motor has a slow gear ratio (72:1), and is not as powerful as the RS-555 series motor.

!> **Warning:** We advise teams to go against the Basic Bot Guide provided by *FIRST™*, as Core Hex Motors should **NOT** be used to power drivetrains.
