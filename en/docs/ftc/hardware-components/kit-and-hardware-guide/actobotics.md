# Actobotics (Discontinued)

!>**Attention**: As of June 2023, ServoCity is [discontinuing the Actobotics line](https://www.servocity.com/blog/farewell-to-actobotics/) to focus on goBILDA. We are retaining these pages as historical reference for teams that continue to have and use Actobotics parts.

The Actobotics kit from ServoCity (https://www.servocity.com/actobotics) is a fixed-pitch, **channel-based** building system using imperial units. Its 1.5" **c-channel** and **ball-bearing** based motion system allows teams to iterate and build mechanisms entirely from kit parts.

## Special Considerations

- Actobotics' **channel** hole pattern has many more mounting holes than a Tetrix channel, so it offers more flexibility in terms of mounting.
- Actobotics uses imperial units across the board, allowing for clean spacing and fitting. However, most other kits use metric.
- Actobotics can interface with other kits such as REV through a variety of Pattern Adapters.
- ServoCity offers a 25% off discount for all *FIRST*® teams making, pricing competitive: [https://www.servocity.com/first_team_discounts](https://www.servocity.com/first_team_discounts).

## Notable Components

- Mini-channel is offered in addition to the standard size **channel** for non-structural components.
- Actobotics' X-rail **extrusion** system offers immense adjustability and flexibility as it adds an **extrusion** component to a **channel-based** kit.
- To complement the structural offerings, Actobotics uses a series of clamping hubs and a robust 1/4" steel **D-shaft**.
- The Linear Motion Kit uses X-rail **extrusion** to build extending mechanisms.
- The **Servoblocks**, which prolong the life of a servo, are recommended for all teams, regardless of kit. However, **Servoblocks** seamlessly interface with the Actobotics ecosystem.
- Actobotics furthermore offers motion options such as **bevel gears** and Linear Actuator kits (using **lead screws**) for specific use cases.

## Verdict

Prior to being discontinued, Actobotics was a solid choice for new teams, offering a reliable base kit with many options to expand upon. Because it is no longer being produced, we recommend teams consider other kits instead.

## Kit of Parts

- [2020-2021 Kit Parts](https://www.servocity.com/ftc-competition-kit-20-21-season/)

## Advantages

- Actobotics provides a great value fixed-pitch build system that is generally easier to assemble than **extrusion-based** systems, which require cutting **extrusion** to length.
- Actobotics has the patented **Servoblocks**, which help drastically increase servo life by protecting it from shock loads. More information may be found in the glossary.
- Actobotics is easily compatible with other build systems such as REV's kit using adapters which can be found on the Servocity website.
- Actobotics is more sturdy than TETRIX in terms of drivetrain flex and has more support options to prevent structural bending.
- The **clamping hubs** offered are more reliable than **set screws**, as clamping engages the shaft in more places than a **set screw** (one face). As discussed in the [TETRIX section](/en/docs/ftc/hardware-components/kit-and-hardware-guide/tetrix), set screws in particular are vulnerable to loosening, especially without application of Loctite.
- Actobotics' motion system is **very** robust and relies on **ball bearings**, which have a lower coefficient of friction than bushings. Actobotics is compatible with the 5mm hex used by REV with their adaptable hubs.
- Actobotics also allows for **face mounting** of motors as opposed to **clamp mounting**.

## Disadvantages

- Actobotics is no longer being produced by ServoCity, so it may be difficult to locate some parts.
- Actobotics is not very cheap, so its cost may be prohibitive for some teams with a low budget. Note that with the 25% off FTC® team discount, Actobotics can be cheaper than TETRIX. The only cheaper build system is REV.
- The XL **belts** from ServoCity are not great. It is recommended that **belts** (**HTD Belt**) be purchased from ServoCity instead, which may necessitate the use of 3D-printed pulleys. There also isn't a large amount of space inside the channel for a belt or chain run, vastly limiting the size of the pulleys.
- **Channel** takes up more space than **extrusion**, so mechanisms can be a bit larger with the Actobotics kit. To remediate this issue, ServoCity sells **mini-channel**, which is a similar size as **extrusion**.
