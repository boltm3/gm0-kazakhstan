# Notebook Designs and Decisions

This section will cover both what needs to be in the notebook and the decisions you need to make about it, affecting both individual sections and the notebook as a whole.

> **Note**: The engineering notebook is completely OPTIONAL. Having a notebook is NOT a requirement for any award. However, judges can technically still ask for the notebook for more information, so some teams still choose to make one. **This article remains here for legacy reasons for teams that wish to make engineering notebooks, even though it is completely optional and not required for teams to still have a shot at awards.** There have been several instances of teams winning high-level awards like Inspire and Think while having no engineering notebook.

## Whole Notebook Decisions

### Condensed vs Long
A trap many teams fall into is thinking that a longer notebook is a better notebook, especially if it contains quality writing. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily true.

At many competitions, especially since the notebook is completely optional, judges often don't have a lot of time to read your notebooks. They will likely only take a cursory scan of a few pages and look more closely at specific pages. Thus, even if you write a great but long notebook, they might miss the highlights and rank you lower than you deserve. The solution is to create a condensed notebook.

This means you should make a conscious effort to remove redundancies and ensure that everything written serves the purpose of being read and gets things checked off for awards.

If you know your state competitions will be longer than a couple of days, write a long, detailed notebook. But if it's only a day-long event, write a concise notebook where every section has a clear purpose.

### Handwritten vs Typed
This decision is up to the team. Some teams swear judges prefer handwritten notebooks, but there is no proof to support this. If your team is small or you prefer writing, go ahead and do so. Be sure that the handwriting is consistent and legible! Typed notebooks are much easier to organize, and judges will definitely be able to read them.

### Serious vs Charming
A team's notebook is an extension of its personality and branding. Some teams choose to come across as a professional engineering firm, while others prefer a more casual, charming approach.

You should aim to reflect your team's character in the notebook. Neither approach is better, but it’s helpful to decide early on the tone of your notebook.

Humor is generally acceptable, but try to keep jokes to a minimum, as the engineering notebook should be a professional-grade document.

> **Note**: Having a consistent team brand is important so judges remember you. A significant part of winning awards is being remembered and advocated for by the judges. Therefore, consistent branding helps judges identify your team and remember what they know about you.

## Individual Sections

Section 9.2.2 of the Judges Manual (|gm1|) lists the types of content expected in your notebook. They are:

- Problem Definition
- Information Gathering
- Brainstorming Solutions
- Concept Design
- System Level Design
- Testing
- Design Improvement
- Production
- Promotion
- Budgeting
- Planning
- Outreach

Specific sections named in the Judges Manual and Notebook Guidelines are not plentiful. They include a team plan, which encompasses all non-robot writing, such as a sustainability plan, strategic plan, and business plan. Doing one of these sections is required for the Inspire award, and knowing what is expected for each section is key.

It’s up to individual notebook writers to decide how to title and organize the sections and what specific content to include in each one.

## Daily Logs and Other Ways of Documenting

Daily logs are a common way of documenting in notebooks. Even teams who are unsure about keeping a notebook typically maintain logs over the course of a few months because they are easy to manage.

Each team approaches logs differently, but a standard approach might look as follows:

**Standard Daily Log Format:**

>Date: [Insert Date]
>
>Members of Team Present: [List Members]
>
>| Tasks & Pictures    | More Information, if the Task Was Completed |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Lorem ipsum         | Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit |
| Sed do eiusmod      | Tempor incididunt ut labore                |
| Et dolore magna     | Aliqua ut enim ad minim veniam             |


Other methods include weekly or bi-weekly logs, which summarize what happened over a period of time. This approach is ideal for smaller teams who might find daily logs too tedious.

A "pure goals" format simply includes:


| Date | Goal and Goal Date  | Was the Goal Completed in Time? |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| Quis | Nostrud             | Exercitation ullamco            |
| Nisi | Ut aliquip ex ea    | Commodo consequat               |
| Duis | Aute irure dolor    | In reprehenderit in voluptate   |



## Building Section and Documenting the Robot

The building section focuses on how your robot fulfills the challenge and the driving factors behind your design decisions.

Information about parts and materials, along with pictures of each mechanism (plus captions), will help the judges understand how the robot works mechanically. Explanations of the components will provide insights into the thought process behind the design.

Ample graphics, such as CAD screenshots/renders and pictures, will help judges understand how your robot works and why the design is effective. **However, make sure that each graphic has a caption or explanation. Do not expect judges to understand how your robot works through pictures alone.**

While CAD screenshots or real-world photos are usually better than high-quality renders, since they better demonstrate the engineering process, both types can work. CAD screenshots, in particular, convey the technical process more clearly and professionally.

Additionally, using math in these explanations is a good way to target the Think award.

The second part of this section is more documentation-heavy, but it is easier in some ways because you will be iterating upon your robot design as you build it. Document the story of how your team progressed from brainstorming to prototyping and finally to the final design. Judges love to follow a logical sequence, as it shows how the team thought through mistakes and improved upon successes.

Each time you make an improvement to your robot or move a step forward in the design process, document it. Key questions to ask when writing this section include:

- What prompted this change? Why was this change made?
- What was the change?
- How was the modification enacted?
- What were the results (good and bad)?
- How can this design be further improved?

This section should also include early ideas your team discussed right after the season began.
