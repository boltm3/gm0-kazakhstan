## Glossary

### Gauge
Wire gauge refers to the diameter of wire. AWG stands for American Wire Gauge, the general system used in the US. The larger the gauge number, the smaller the wire diameter. Generally, **servo** wires are 22 AWG and motor wires are 18 AWG.

### Grounding Strap
The REV Grounding Strap is used to ground the metal frame of the robot to the **XT30** port of the Expansion Hub. It is currently the only legal way to ground your robot.

### USB Retention Mount
The USB Retention Mount, sold by REV, is a plastic part affixed to the Expansion Hub that relieves stress on the USB Mini port. This is especially important because if the USB cable is loose or disconnected, the robot phone cannot communicate with the Expansion Hub, causing a disconnect.

>**Note**: For teams using an expansion hub, it is highly recommended to purchase the USB retention mount.
