# Servo Guide

> **Term** :
    **Servo**
>    
>    A **servo** is a small DC motor attached to servo gears that is very finely controllable and interfaces via a 3-wire PWM connector. Servos are used in FTC for high-precision applications that are low-load, such as opening a trapdoor for balls to fall through. Typically, servos have a limited range of rotation (180Â° is common). The output has splines, which are the rigid teeth on top of the servo.

Servos are commonly used in RC cars (for steering) and RC planes (for moving ailerons). In FTC, servos are typically used for claws, grabbers, and arms.

> **Note:** Servos are **NOT** replacements for DC motors and should not be used as such. Servos are made for fine-tuned and accurate movement, not high-load or fast rotation applications.

There are many servos from different manufacturers, which vary widely in price, performance, and value. Fortunately, virtually all servos use the standard 3-wire connector and accept the same kind of controlling signal (PWM signal at 50 Hz). Each REV Expansion Hub provides 6 servo ports, so you can plug in a servo from any manufacturer. Additionally, there is a standard size for servos for FTC use, so mounts can be interchanged between manufacturers.

Commonly used servos in FTC include the REV Smart Servo and goBILDA Dual Mode Servos (e.g., [25-2](https://www.gobilda.com/2000-series-dual-mode-servo-25-2/) and [25-3](https://www.gobilda.com/2000-series-dual-mode-servo-25-3-speed/)). However, you should also check out other servos. Picking the right servo for your application is a question that's almost impossible to give a blanket answer for. To learn more, please read the [choosing-servo](en/docs/ftc/power-and-electronics/servo-guide/choosing-servo) section.

The most prevalent problem with servos is durability. Internal servo gears in cheaper servos strip easily when subjected to shock loads. Servos are also poor at handling lateral loads or bending of the shaft. To avoid having to frequently replace servos, choose ones with metal gears and use **Servoblocks** or your kit's equivalent to prolong longevity.
