# Awards

*FIRST*® Tech Challenge is more than just building robots; it includes elements of engineering documentation, outreach, and more. While the majority of the *FIRST* Tech Challenge (FTC) guidelines focus on robot-building decisions, the portfolio you create showcases how you made those decisions and how you impact the STEM community in a positive way.

**It only benefits you to go for awards. You can't win awards without making a portfolio, and in certain states, the only way to advance is through awards. In other states, awards can significantly ease your advancement.** In the past, an engineering notebook was required for awards, but this is no longer the case. Therefore, the following topics will be covered in this section of the guidelines.

> **Warning**: Judging and awards are extremely subjective, and some rules change slightly from state to state. What works in one region may not work in another. Contact your judges for specifics; for example, some competitions allow teams to submit a custom control award sheet, while others only accept the one listed by *FIRST*. The writers of this section have extensive experience with awards and have even been winners and finalists for the Inspire Award at the World Championships.

For most awards, teams have a 5-minute presentation at the beginning of the day, followed by some Q&A time and possibly pit judging later on (refer to the section on the judging process for more details). There are 7 awards for FTC® teams (excluding awards that do not contribute to advancing a team).

For winning every award, the Engineering Portfolio is a key reference and is crucial, so make sure your team focuses on the Engineering Portfolio.

Always remember that regardless of how well you feel your team did, awards are subject to the judges' perspectives, and there is no way to 100% control the outcome of awards.

Overall, awards are one of the core parts of the *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition. They recognize teams at the end of every competition (except league meets) and determine many of the teams that advance.
