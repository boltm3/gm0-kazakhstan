# Power Transmission

When building any mechanism, it is important to consider how the mechanism will be powered, as gear ratio and form factor are two factors that affect both spacing and efficiency. There are four main forms of power transmission: direct drive, gears, chain, and timing belt. In addition, there are different ways of powering a mechanism that is mounted on an axle.
