# Hardware

## Design Strategy
A list of general tips for your team's design process.

## Design Tradeoffs
Goes over some common robot design decisions and typically superior alternatives to them.

[Design Tradeoffs](en/docs/ftc/common-mechanisms/design-tradeoffs)

## Drivetrains
Because it doesn't matter how good the rest of your mechanisms are if the robot cannot get to where it needs to be (except maybe if you're 8813 in Relic Recovery).

## Active Intake
Because you want to be able to pick stuff up. Touch it, own it.

## Linear Motion Guide
Moving things further than the constraints of the robot is an extremely common task, and linear motion is often one of the best ways to do this.

## Power Transmission
Different ways to get rotation from point A to point B.

# Programming/Control System

## Options for Programming
Because without programming, the robot is just an expensive brick.

[Options for Programming](en/docs/ftc/software/getting-started/options-for-programming)

## Control Systems
Because without a control system, the robot is just a (significantly less) expensive brick.

[Control Systems](en/docs/ftc/power-and-electronics/control-system)

## Wiring Guide
Because disconnects are no fun.

## Programming Tutorial - Mecanum Drivetrain
Because mecanum wheels without the right code are some very expensive questionable quality traction wheels.

## Computer Vision
Explains the different common computer vision systems and how to use them (hopefully this doesn't end with a robot uprising).
